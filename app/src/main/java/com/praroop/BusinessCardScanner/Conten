# 📇 Business Card & Handwriting Scanner App (ML Kit + Jetpack Compose)

## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate **Google ML Kit** into a modern **Jetpack Compose Android app** to scan **business cards** and **handwritten notes**.
It uses **Text Recognition API** from ML Kit to detect and extract text from camera-captured images in real time or from gallery images.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Scan **business cards** — extract name, phone number, and email.
✅ Scan **handwritten notes** — detect handwritten text with ML Kit’s on-device model.
✅ Built using **Jetpack Compose CameraX** for live preview and capture.
✅ **Offline processing** — ML Kit runs on-device; no internet required.
✅ Modern Android stack — Kotlin, Compose, and CameraX.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **CameraX** captures the image (business card or handwritten note).
2. The image is sent to **ML Kit TextRecognizer**.
3. ML Kit detects text blocks, lines, and elements from the image.
4. The recognized text is displayed on screen or extracted to structured fields (name, email, phone, etc.).

## 🧠 Understanding ML Kit Text Recognition

* **Model:** On-device OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
* **Supports:** Typed and Handwritten English text.
* **Steps:**

  1. Initialize `TextRecognizer`.
  2. Pass an `InputImage` (from bitmap, URI, or media image).
  3. ML Kit processes and returns a `Text` object containing blocks, lines, and words.
  4. Parse these results to extract key details (for business cards).

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

* Business Card Scanner → auto-fills contact details.
* Handwriting Notes App → digitizes handwritten notes for saving or sharing.
* OCR Tool for Receipts, Documents, or IDs.

## 🧰 Dependencies

```gradle
implementation "androidx.camera:camera-core:1.3.0"
implementation "androidx.camera:camera-camera2:1.3.0"
implementation "androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle:1.3.0"
implementation "androidx.camera:camera-view:1.3.0"

## 🧑‍💻 Future Improvements

* Add support for multiple languages (Hindi, Spanish, etc.)
* Integrate with Cloud Vision API for better accuracy.
* Auto-detect card type (business card, handwritten, document).
* Save scanned results to local DB (Room) or Cloud (Firebase).

## 🗣 Interview Preparation Notes

Be ready to explain:

* How ML Kit Text Recognition works internally (OCR + TensorFlow Lite).
* Difference between on-device and cloud-based ML models.
* Why use CameraX (lifecycle-aware, modern, easy integration).
* Security — processing on-device ensures **user privacy** and **data safety**.
* Future extension — integrate **TFLite custom models** for signature or handwriting style detection.

Would you like me to add a **“Setup Instructions”** section (like how to configure CameraX and ML Kit API step-by-step for new developers)?
It’ll make your README look complete and professional.
